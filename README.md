# Don't Outsource Thinking

A curated collection of insights, visuals, and discussions on the future of software engineering in the age of AI. This project serves as a manifesto and resource hub for developers navigating the transition from traditional coding to AI-augmented engineering.

## 🧠 Philosophy

The core message is simple: **AI should amplify human thought, not replace it.**

We advocate for:
- **Engineering Beyond the Vibe:** Moving from "vibe coding" to structured, strategic engineering.
- **Context Engineering:** Curating inputs for AI to get superior outputs.
- **Active Thinking:** Using AI to execute plans, not to formulate them without oversight.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Visuals:** High-impact imagery representing the state of AI and software engineering.
- **Agenda:** Core concepts like "No Vibe Allowed", "AI Dumb Zone", and "RPI (Research, Plan, Implement)".
- **Slides:** Presentation slides from "Engineering Beyond the Vibe".
- **Resources:** PDF documents including "Cognitive Architecture of Software Engineering".
- **Media:** Video discussions and podcast episodes on AI control vs. independence.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core:** Semantic HTML5
- **Styling:** Modern CSS3 with CSS Variables
  - Dark Mode / Cyberpunk Aesthetic
  - Glassmorphism effects
  - Responsive Grid Layouts
  - Dynamic Accent Colors (HSL rotation on scroll)
- **Interactivity:** Vanilla JavaScript
  - Intersection Observer for scroll animations
  - Custom Lightbox for image viewing
  - Audio Visualizer animation
  - Mobile-friendly touch sliders
